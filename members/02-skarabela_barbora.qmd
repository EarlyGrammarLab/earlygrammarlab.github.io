I joined the EAGLeLab at the [*Institute of Psychology of the Czech Academy of Sciences*](https://psu.cas.cz/en/) as Senior Researcher in January 2025. My research centres on child language development, with a particular focus on how children acquire grammar and learn to navigate discourse, using a combination of experimental and corpus-based methods.

I began my academic journey in the Czech Republic, earning a Bachelor’s degree at Palacký University in Olomouc. I continued with my postgraduate studies in the United States, completing a PhD in Applied Linguistics at Boston University. My doctoral research explored language development in children acquiring Inuktitut, an indigenous language spoken in Northern Canada.

I joined the University of Edinburgh as a Teaching Fellow in Language Acquisition and have since held various research posts. I’m a founding member of the Wee Science developmental lab in the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences and the Edinburgh Laboratory for Language Development (ELfLanD). Since 2019, I’ve held the post of Knowledge Exchange and Impact Officer working with the Lothian Birth Cohorts, a longitudinal research study of brain and cognitive ageing. I lead the group’s public engagement activities and support the team in developing and delivering research impact. I also edit the Disconnected Mind Newsletter, a quarterly publication that shares updates and insights from the Lothian Birth Cohorts.
