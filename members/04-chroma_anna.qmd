I am a PhD student and a junior researcher at Faculty of Arts, Charles University, and a junior researcher at the [*Institute of Psychology, Czech Academy of Sciences*](https://psu.cas.cz/en/).

I founded the group [*CoCzeFLA*](https://coczefla.ff.cuni.cz/) under which child language corpora are built and I further work to develop it. My PhD project is concerned with the acquision of *I* and *You* pronouns and other ways of referring to self and others. Within EAGLeLab, I study early comprehension of case morphology in Czech, also in comparison to German.
