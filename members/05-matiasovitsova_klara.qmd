I am a PhD student and a junior researcher at the [*Faculty of Arts, Charles University*](https://www.ff.cuni.cz/), and a junior researcher at the [*Institute of Psychology, Czech Academy of Sciences*](https://psu.cas.cz/en/).

My main focus is the language development of preschool and early school-age children with language difficulties (developmental language disorder), particularly their acquisition of grammar in comparison to typically developing children. In my PhD thesis, I examine the relation between sentence imitation ability, working memory, and language skills in these children.

I also co-lead the development of the child language corpora [*CoCzeFLA*](https://coczefla.ff.cuni.cz/), where I am primarily responsible for coordinating their morphological annotation.
