I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [*Institute of Psychology, Czech Academy of Sciences*](https://psu.cas.cz/en/). I hold a degree in Formal Linguistics from the University of Padua (Italy) and a PhD in Psychology, Linguistics, and Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy).

My current research investigates how social and semantic knowledge influence morphosyntactic gender agreement. More broadly, I am interested in understanding how extra-linguistic knowledge interacts with strict morphosyntactic rules and in identifying the linguistic features that guide syntactic agreement processes.
